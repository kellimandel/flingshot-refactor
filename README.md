# Flingshot

What is it?
-----------

Flingshot uses Phaser, a phsyics engine, to simulate a game where you can hit students from the back of classroom. The game is sparked from our childhood imagination to tease other students in our class. Never attempted in real life, we created this game to fulfill your fantasy without getting yourself suspended. This is a fun, quick, low-stake, yet addicting game for people looking for ways to take a short break from work.

**Installation**

No hardware installation is necessary. Please visit http://taneeya96.github.io/Great-Expectasians/Flingshot/ and enjoy the game.

**Instruction**

Users can drag anywhere from the screen to shoot paper balls at only students who raise their hands. Users get 10 points for hitting the right student, and lose 5 points for hitting the wrong one. The student raising their hand will change at random, and this change will happen at quicker at higher level. Each level lasts 30 seconds (shown by a timer in the top left corner) and a score goal users need to meet to progress to the next level. There are seven levels in this game with increasing difficulties. 

**FAQ**

1. Do I have to drag from the flingshot to launch the ball?

No. It's actually to your advantage to drag from different places on the screen to launch the ball faster.

2. Which student do I hit?

The one who lights up and raises their hand.

3. How do I win this game?

You need to reach the level score goal, displayed next to your current score and in the level progress bar, to move to the next level. The game will progressingly become more challenging and exciting to play.

Developer Documentation
-----------------------

This is a working version of the game. To clone the latest version, please visit https://github.com/taneeya96/Great-Expectasians.

This game is written with JavaScript and uses Phaser as the game engine. It requires Phaser 2.6.2 or later, and HTML5 or later. Please visit https://phaser.io/ for documentation and tutorials. Additionally, polylines for collision objects in this game were created using PhysicsEditor. Animations in the game are created using sprite sheets of Phaser.

Download Webstorm
If you have a unversity account, you can get a student licence for downloading the professional version. If not, community edition is just fine.
You do not have to download Phaser that it’s source code is included in our project.

Clone with Webstorm
Click ‘VCS’ >> ‘Check out from Version Control’ >> Git in Webstorm start menu. Log in to your github account. Copy our github repository URL and paste it to ‘Git Repository URL’.

Running the game on Webstorm
Webstorm has its own local server. Open index.html in Webstorm and on the upper-right side, click on the brower icon you want to run.

This game was written with JavaScript and used Phaser as the game engine. It requires Phaser 2.7.7 or later, and HTML5 or later. Please visit https://phaser.io/ to install the game engine and check out their tutorials/documentations. Additionally, polylines for collision objects in this game were created using PhysicsEditor, though any similar software would work. Animations in the game are created using sprite sheets. After cloning or downloading the project, run it using your local server. 

**Current state of project**

The current project has all the essential features we envisioned our game to have. In the first version of the game, we had the ball launcher control schemes (the arrow), the physics of the balls (flying motion and collision detection) and students working. We also had level timer and level score goals implemented so users can level up. After much user testings, in the second version of the game, we polished the graphics, made elements in the UI display (i.e. buttons, score, timer, transparency of students, display of plus points) more obvious to convey the game play better. We also added sound effects, student reaction animations and background animations (the teacher) to make the game more polished and engaging.

**Future work**

We would like to add more levels and vary the difficulty and predictability of the game by adding moving targets or rearranging the placements of the students. At present, users also cannot go back to the instruction page once they've entered the play state.
